# 🚀 InvestCore AI

**Intelligent Investment Analysis & Portfolio Management Powered by AI**

InvestCore AI is a sophisticated financial analysis platform that combines natural language processing with real-time market data to provide comprehensive investment insights, portfolio analysis, and market assessments.

## ✨ What It Does

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Investment Analysis**
InvestCore transforms how you analyze investments by letting you ask questions in plain English. Instead of learning complex financial software, you can simply ask:

- *"Should I invest in Apple stock?"*
- *"What are the best tech stocks under $100?"*
- *"How is the healthcare sector performing?"*
- *"Create a portfolio for me with 60% stocks and 40% bonds"*

The AI automatically understands your intent and runs the appropriate financial analysis commands to give you comprehensive insights.

### 📊 **Comprehensive Financial Intelligence**
The platform aggregates data from multiple sources to give you a complete picture:

- **Real-time Market Data** - Live prices, volume, market cap, and trading metrics
- **Financial Statements** - Balance sheets, income statements, cash flow analysis
- **Earnings Analysis** - Quarterly reports, earnings surprises, growth trends
- **Economic Indicators** - GDP, inflation, interest rates, and market sentiment
- **Sector Performance** - Industry comparisons and sector rotation analysis

### 🎯 **Smart Portfolio Management**
InvestCore doesn't just show you data—it helps you make decisions:

- **Asset Screening** - Filter stocks based on your criteria (P/E ratios, market cap, growth rates)
